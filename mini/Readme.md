## Challenge Overview:  
  
In healthcare, it is a common practice to encode diagnosis and procedures into few of the alphanumeric codes for the ease of billing purposes. Not only these encoding schemes help practitioners to clearly identify attributes of the diagnosis, but also to insurance companies to process the claims more accurately. Below are some of the most common encoding schemes are SNOMED and ICD10.  

Diseases in older electronic health records (EHR) that are encoded in SNOMED terminologies need to be mapped to ICD-10 codes. In this mini-challenge, you will compete to build a tool that can unlock older datasets encoded with SNOMED.  This will enable powerful new AI to use that data.
