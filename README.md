# Main Challenge: Personalized, digital medicine in the age of COVID and beyond

## Description: 
The COVID pandemic has disrupted the traditional medical model, and this year for the first time ever, more than 50% of Americans have done medicine digitally. Anthem's mission is to accelerate this innovation by building higher quality, more affordable, and more convenient medicine, and we need your help. In this hackathon, we ask that you invent a solution that could be part of this disruptive trend.

## Possible use cases: 
* Medicine for COVID
* Digital delivery of medicine
* More efficient medical system
* Portable, wearable and at-home medicine
* Other innovative ideas


## Examples of Projects
* An app to support people with a specific mental health diagnosis
* An AI-powered medical advisor for COVID-19
* New functionality in a healthcare-related open source project (app, dataset) 
* An innovative app that simplifies buying medical insurance and medical bills
* Making a novel use of a wearable sensor
* Mining an unexplored healthcare dataset and making the data usable
* Developing an open source middleware solution that makes building solutions easier

We welcome both functional software solutions and an innovative mock-up of your solution. Our challenge is set to deepen the thinking of ‘What is next in digital medicine and health care delivery’. This industry is rapidly advancing and having a new generation of thinking can help shape how healthcare is delivered digitally.

The top team will have a private meeting with Anthem's VP and engineering team


## Mini-Challenge
Decoding the SNOMED
In healthcare, it is a common practice to encode diagnosis and procedures into certain codes for the ease of claims and billing purpose. Not only these encoding schemes help practitioners to clearly identify attributes of the diagnosis, but also to insurance companies to process the claims more accurately. Below are some of the most common encoding schemes:

1. SNOMED-CT: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms
2. ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases 10th revision

Electronic health records (EHR) are often encoded in SNOMED terminologies and these need to be mapped to ICD-10 codes. In this mini-challenge, you will compete to build a tool that will perform the conversion by understanding medical rules. Your code could be used to unlock datasets encoded with SNOMED and enable powerful new AI trained on SNOWMED data.
